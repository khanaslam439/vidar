# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Movies are no longer hidden and silent when exporting.
- `refresh` can be called when the movie is playing or recording to force render.

### Removed
- Image layers' `imageX`, `imageY`, `imageWidth` and `imageHeight` properties. Every image is now rendered over its entire layer.
- Video layers' `mediaX`, `mediaY`, `mediaWidth` and `mediaHeight` properties. Every video is now rendered over its entire layer.

### Fixed
- Video layers' `clipWidth` and `clipHeight` are no longer treated as invalid options.
- Image layers' `clipWidth` and `clipHeight` are no longer set in the constructor, so if the `clipWidth` option is not supplied and the layer's `width` changes `clipWidth` uses the new `width`.
- Video and image layers' `width` and `height` default to their `clipWidth` and `clipHeight` respectively.
- Elliptical mask effect throwing `TypeError: path.split is not a function`.
- In shader effects, textures whose dimensions are not powers of two accept interpolation filters.
- No longer ignore video layers' `mediaWidth` option.
- Treat layers' `enabled` property as dynamic (allowing for keyframes and functions).
- Make each media layer's duration depend on its playback rate.
- Fix recording with only video or only audio.

### Security
- Update vulnerable dependencies.

## [0.6.0] - 2019-12-26
### Added
- Add [API documentation](https://clabe45.github.io/vidar/).
- Support enabling and disabling layers and effects.
- Implement more movie events (*movie.play*, *movie.record*, *movie.pause*, *movie.change.duration*).
- Implement [property filters](https://github.com/clabe45/vidar/wiki/Property-Filters).
- Implement property caching.
- Media layer supports media whose duration changes.
- Add unimplemented `vd.Font` properties.
- Add example that uses a live stream (the webcam).

### Changed
- Add layer `start` and `stop` methods.
- Add layer and effect `attach` and `detach` methods.
- Make some properties public (`_getDefaultOptions`, `_publicExcludes`, `layer.Base#_render`, `event._publish`, `layer.Base#_render`, `event._publish`, `layer.Visual#_doRender`).
- Change `vd.val(property, element, time)` &rarr; `vd.val(element, path, time)`.
- Make event properties specific to event type
  - *layer.attach|detach*: `source` &rarr; `effectTarget`
  - *effect.attach|detach*: `source` &rarr; `effectTarget`
  - *movie.change.layer.add|remove*: `source` &rarr; `layer`
  - *movie.change.effect.add|remove*: `source` &rarr; `effect`

### Fixed
- Media current time is no longer reset every time it's played.
- Fix Gaussian blur effect throwing error.
- Custom textures work for shader effects.
- Fix undefined behavior with shader effects that output transparency.
- Use `sourceTextureOptions` in shader effects.
- Recursive property changes now emit events with `vd.watchPublic`.
- Public properties set to keyframes are treated as keyframes.
- Update event names in examples.

## [0.5.0] - 2019-10-09
### Added
- Movies and layers auto-refresh.

### Changed
- Rewrite event system.
  - Events propogate up.
  - Event names are organized into groups.

### Fixed
- Update IIFE global export from `mv` to `vd`.
- Fix recording audio.
- Fix recording movies without audio in Chrome.
- Fix effects for movies.

## [0.4.0] - 2019-08-18
### Added
- WebGL fragment shader effects, with which you can re-render a layer or movie with a GLSL fragment shader.
- New `initialRefresh` movie option that can prevent rendering on init.

### Changed
- Most visual effects now use GLSL.
- New `element` argument passed to function properties to see which Vidar object the property belongs to.

## [0.3.0] - 2018-12-11
### Added
- Function properties.
  - Dynamic properties that call a function every time they're queried.

### Changed
- Null or undefined layer dimensions default to the width or height of the movie.
- Movie "end" event is now called "ended".

### Fixed
- Bug with layer options

### Removed
- Volume, speed and muted properties. These will most likely be added as separate audio effects in the future.

## [0.2.0] - 2018-10-14
### Added
- Keyframes
  - Works with any value type in pretty much every built-in component property.
  - Number and objects, including colors and fonts, can interpolate.
  - Custom interpolation option.
- Elliptical mask effect.
- Many small improvements.
